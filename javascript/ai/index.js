//Alpha-beta pruning

//The Minimax is a recursive algorithm which can be used for solving two-player zero-sum games
//steps: 
	//searches through the space of possible game states creating a tree
	// which is expanded until it reaches a particular predefined depth
		//how deep should I define it

	//each level represents the turn of one of the two players. In order to win each player must select the move that minimizes the opponentâ€™s maximum payoff.
